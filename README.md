# Google Sheets to Google Docs Text Export Script

## Overview

This script is designed to export text from a selected range of Google Sheets into a Google Docs document, while retaining all text formatting. It provides an easy-to-use custom menu that allows for a seamless transition of data, preserving complex formatting attributes such as bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, font color, and more.

## Features

- **Rich Text Formatting**: Exports text from Google Sheets to Google Docs with full formatting support, including:
  - Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough.
  - Font color, background color, font family, and font size.
  - Supports multiple formatting styles within a single cell.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: Adds a custom menu called `Custom Scripts` to Google Sheets to easily initiate the export process.
- **Configurable Logging**: Includes optional logging functionality for debugging purposes, which can be toggled on or off by setting `LOGGING_ENABLED`.

## How It Works

The script follows a simple flow to ensure that data is correctly exported:

1. **Custom Menu Creation**: After installation, a custom menu named `Custom Scripts` appears in Google Sheets.
2. **Range Selection**: Users select a range of cells that they wish to export to a new Google Docs document.
3. **Data Export**: The script transfers the selected data, preserving the formatting.

## Installation

1. **Open Google Sheet**: Open the Google Sheet where you want to use this script.
2. **Access Script Editor**: Go to `Extensions > Apps Script` to open the Google Apps Script editor.
3. **Paste the Script**: Copy and paste the provided code into the editor.
4. **Save & Refresh**: Save the script and refresh the Google Sheet.
5. **Use the Custom Menu**: After refreshing, a new menu item named `Custom Scripts` will appear in the Google Sheets menu bar.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Select the Range**: Highlight the range of cells in Google Sheets that you wish to export.
2. **Open the Custom Menu**: Click on `Custom Scripts` in the menu bar.
3. **Export the Data**: Choose `Export to Google Doc`. A new Google Docs document will be created, containing the selected range with all text formatting preserved.

## Key Configuration

- **Logging**: The script contains a `LOGGING_ENABLED` variable, which can be set to `true` to enable detailed logging of the export process. This is particularly helpful for debugging or verifying the correct operation of the script.
- **Range Size Limit**: The script currently supports exporting up to **1000 cells** at a time. Exporting larger ranges may result in performance issues or errors.

## Example Use Case

Imagine you have a table in Google Sheets that contains a mixture of formatted texts, such as bold headers, underlined rows, and cells with different background colors. You can use this script to transfer all of this content into a Google Docs document, ensuring that every style and format remains intact.

## Limitations

- **Performance**: The script may struggle with very large data sets (over 1000 cells). It is optimized for smaller ranges to avoid exceeding Google Apps Script limitations.
- **Formatting Support**: While the script supports a wide array of formatting options, some edge cases involving highly complex formatting may not be transferred perfectly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Logging for Debugging**: If something doesnâ€™t work as expected, enable logging by setting `LOGGING_ENABLED = true` in the script. Logs can be viewed using the `Logger.log()` method in Google Apps Script.
- **Error Messages**: If you encounter an error regarding range size, try selecting a smaller range and re-running the script.
